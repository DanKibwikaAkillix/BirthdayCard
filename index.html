    <h1>Happy Birthday Wilfried </h1>
    <p class="title">ðŸŽ‰ On your special day, We want to take a moment to express just how much you mean to all of us. Youâ€™re not just a mentor, but a beacon of wisdom, kindness, and strength. Your unwavering support, guidance, and belief in others have had a profound impact on all who have had the privilege of learning from you.

        Your generosity, not just in sharing knowledge but in uplifting spirits, is something rare and beautiful. You inspire everyone around you to push boundaries, chase dreams, and be better versions of themselves. For that, and so much more, We are deeply grateful.
        
        May this year bring you as much joy, success, and fulfillment as you have brought to those lucky enough to cross your path. You deserve all the happiness in the world.
        
        Thank you for being the incredible person you are. Hereâ€™s to many more years of greatness, wisdom, and moments of pure joy! ðŸŽˆ</p>
